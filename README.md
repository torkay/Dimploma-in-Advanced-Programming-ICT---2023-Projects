## Lesson 1:
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Math Quiz
      Brief: A simple math quiz that asks the user's name and then generates two random numbers to perform a multiplication operation. The user inputs the result and the program displays whether the answer is correct or not. Finally, the user is asked to guess the operation performed.
      Lines of code: 34

  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Math Quiz with Multiple Operations
      Brief: An extension of the previous math quiz with added functionality for performing multiple mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is given 10 questions and the score is displayed at the end. The user has the option to play the quiz again.
      Lines of code: 64

## Lesson 2:
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Day of the Week
      Brief: A program that asks the user for the day of the week and outputs the corresponding message based on the input.
      Lines of code: 65
      
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Geometry Calculator
      Brief: A Java program that calculates the area or perimeter of a rectangle or triangle based on user input. The user inputs the shape and relevant dimensions, and the program uses a switch statement and a separate method to perform the calculation before printing the result for the user.
      Lines of code: 82
      
## Lesson 3: 
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Simple Calculator
      Brief: A simple Java program that takes input from the user for two numbers, adds them together, and outputs the result.
      Lines of code: 15

  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Odd or Even Game
      Brief: A simple guessing game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 200 and the user has to guess if it's odd or even. The program displays the answer and asks if the user wants to play again.
      Lines of code: 58
      üåê See 'Lesson1_0.docx' page 4 for reference
    
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Reverse Guessing Game
      Brief: A Java implementation of a number guessing game where a computer randomly generates a number and the player inputs if the number is too high, too low, or correct. The game continues until the player correctly guesses the number or is determined to not be playing fair.
