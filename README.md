# Java Development
## Legend:
  - Lessons 1Ô∏è‚É£, 2Ô∏è‚É£, 3Ô∏è‚É£ refer to the lesson in which the application was developed respective to my colledges weekly lessons
  - '‚û°Ô∏è' refers to the corresponding project that was developed, ordered according to my progression throughout the coursework
  - 'üåê' indicates the project and its corresponding pseudocode documentation

## Lesson 1:
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Math Quiz
    ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This project is a simple math quiz that asks the user's name and then generates two random numbers to perform a multiplication operation. The user is then asked to input the result and the program will display whether the answer is correct or not. Finally, the user is asked to guess the operation performed.
    ‚Ä¢ **Lines of code:** 34

  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Math Quiz with Multiple Operations
    ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This project is an extension of the previous math quiz with added functionality to perform multiple mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The user is given 10 questions, and the score is displayed at the end. The user has the option to play the quiz again.
    ‚Ä¢ **Lines of code:** 64

## Lesson 2:
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Day of the Week
    ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This program asks the user for the day of the week and outputs the corresponding message based on the input.
    ‚Ä¢ **Lines of code:** 65
      
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Geometry Calculator
    ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This Java program is a geometry calculator that calculates either the area or perimeter of either a rectangle or triangle, based on user input. The user inputs the shape they want to calculate the area or perimeter of, and the relevant dimensions of that shape. The program then uses a switch statement and calls a separate method "calculate" to perform the calculation, before returning the result to the main method and printing it for the user.
    ‚Ä¢ **Lines of code:** 82

## Lesson 3: 
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Simple Calculator
    ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This is a simple Java program that takes input from the user for two numbers, adds them together, and then outputs the result. The program uses the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user and the System.out.println() method to output the result.
    ‚Ä¢ **Lines of code:** 15
    ‚Ä¢ **üåê See 'Lesson1_0.docx' page 2 for reference**
      
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Odd or Even Game
    ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** A simple guessing game where the program generates a random number between 1 and 200 and the user has to guess whether it's odd or even. The program then displays whether the answer is correct or not, and asks the user if they want to play again. The program uses the java.util.Scanner class to read input from the user and the java.util.Random class to generate the random number.
    ‚Ä¢ **Lines of code:** 58
    ‚Ä¢ **üåê See 'Lesson1_0.docx' page 4 for reference**
    
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 2: Reverse Guessing Game
    ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** This code is a Java implementation of a number guessing game where a computer randomly generates a number within a given range, and the player provides input if the number is too high, too low, or correct

## Lesson 4:
  ‚û°Ô∏è Project 1: Temperature Calculator With Swift Graphical User Interface
    ‚Ä¢ **Brief:** Similar to the previous console-based temperature calculator made in java, this calculator utilises JavaX's swift library. The window also utilises the awt library to find the user's resolution to incorperate a window-centric smart feature. The design is brief and understandable with side-by-side buttons and instructive titles
